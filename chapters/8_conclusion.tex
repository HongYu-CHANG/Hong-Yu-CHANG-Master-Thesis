\chapter{Conclusions } \label{chapter:conclusion}

We have introduced FacePush, a pulley system based mechanism integrated with head mounted displays to present the sensation of normal forces acting on a user's face in VR experiences. We conducted experiments to identify the absolute detection threshold and the discrimination threshold which informed an effective design for noticeable and discernible normal force and in addition, measured the comfort levels of users of FacePush. In this study a normal force was applied in three different ways and displayed in three different scenarios, namely boxing, diving, and attention guidance. According to the results of user study 2, FacePush significantly enhances the VR experience.
